## Problem

Alice and Bazza are playing the **inekoalaty game**, a two-player game whose rules depend on a positive real number \(\lambda\) known to both players. On the \(n\)-th turn of the game (starting with \(n=1\)), the following happens:

- If \(n\) is odd, Alice chooses a nonnegative real number \(x_n\) such that
\[
x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \le \lambda n.
\]

- If \(n\) is even, Bazza chooses a nonnegative real number \(x_n\) such that
\[
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 \le n.
\]

If a player cannot choose a suitable \(x_n\), the game ends and the other player wins. If the game goes on forever, neither player wins. All chosen numbers are known to both players.

Determine all values of \(\lambda\) for which Alice has a winning strategy and all those for which Bazza has a winning strategy.

## Submission

To determine the conditions under which **Alice** or **Bazza** has a winning strategy in the *inekoalaty game*, we analyze the optimal play of both players based on their respective constraints and the recursive nature of the game.

### **Game Overview**

- The game proceeds in turns $ n = 1, 2, 3, \ldots $
- On **odd** $ n $ (Alice’s turn), she chooses $ x_n \geq 0 $ such that:
  $$
  x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \leq \lambda n
  $$
- On **even** $ n $ (Bazza’s turn), he chooses $ x_n \geq 0 $ such that:
  $$
  x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 \leq n
  $$
- If a player cannot choose a valid $ x_n $, they lose immediately.
- If the game continues indefinitely, **neither player wins**.

### **Key Observations and Strategy**

Let us denote:

- $ s_k = S_{2k} $: the **sum** after Bazza’s $ k $-th move (i.e., at turn $ n = 2k $).
- $ Q_{2k} = 2k $: the **sum of squares** after Bazza’s $ k $-th move (since he sets it to the maximum possible without violating the constraint).

At Alice’s $ k $-th turn (at $ n = 2k - 1 $):

- She must ensure that $ s_{k-1} \leq \lambda(2k - 1) $ to be able to play.
- She can choose $ x_{2k-1} \in [0, \lambda(2k - 1) - s_{k-1}] $.
- To prevent Bazza from playing, she wants $ Q_{2k-1} = Q_{2k-2} + x_{2k-1}^2 > 2k $, i.e., $ x_{2k-1} > \sqrt{2} $.
- Thus, if $ \lambda(2k - 1) - s_{k-1} > \sqrt{2} $, then Alice can win at this step by choosing $ x_{2k-1} > \sqrt{2} $.

The crucial recurrence is derived from the fact that **Bazza always plays to maximize the next sum**, and thus the minimal sum $ s_{k} $ Alice can force is:
$$
s_k = s_{k-1} + \sqrt{2}, \quad s_0 = 0
$$
So,
$$
s_k = k\sqrt{2}
$$

Thus, for Alice to play at her $ k $-th turn, it must hold that:
$$
\lambda(2k - 1) - (k - 1)\sqrt{2} > 0 \quad \text{(to play)}
$$
and
$$
\lambda(2k - 1) - (k - 1)\sqrt{2} > \sqrt{2} \quad \text{(to win)}
$$

This leads to the following condition for Alice to win **at some finite turn**:
$$
\lambda > \frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2k - 1}
$$

As $ k \to \infty $, the right-hand side tends to:
$$
\lim_{k \to \infty} \frac{k\sqrt{2}}{2k - 1} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
$$

Hence, **for all $ \lambda > \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $**, there exists some $ k $ such that Alice can win at her $ k $-th turn.

Conversely, for $ \lambda < \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $, for sufficiently large $ k $, we have:
$$
\lambda(2k - 1) < (k - 1)\sqrt{2}
\Rightarrow \lambda(2k - 1) - (k - 1)\sqrt{2} < 0
$$
So Alice **cannot** play at her $ k $-th turn, and **Bazza wins**.

Finally, for $ \lambda = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $, it holds that:
$$
\lambda(2k - 1) - (k - 1)\sqrt{2} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}
$$
which is strictly between 0 and $ \sqrt{2} $, so **both players can always play**, and the game continues **indefinitely**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Alice has a winning strategy** if and only if $ \lambda > \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $
- **Bazza has a winning strategy** if and only if $ \lambda < \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $
- **Neither player wins** (game goes on forever) when $ \lambda = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2} $

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{
\begin{aligned}
&\text{Alice has a winning strategy if and only if } \lambda > \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\
&\text{Bazza has a winning strategy if and only if } \lambda < \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}, \\
&\text{and the game is infinite (neither wins) when } \lambda = \dfrac{\sqrt{2}}{2}.
\end{aligned}
