## Problem

Consider a \(2025 \times 2025\) grid of unit squares. Matilda wishes to place on the grid some rectangular tiles, possibly of different sizes, such that each side of every tile lies on a grid line and every unit square is covered by at most one tile.

Determine the minimum number of tiles Matilda needs to place so that each row and each column of the grid has exactly one unit square that is not covered by any tile.

## Submission

To solve the problem, we are given a $2025 \times 2025$ grid and asked to determine the **minimum number of rectangular tiles** Matilda must place such that:

- Each tile is axis-aligned and covers only unit squares.
- Every unit square is covered by at most one tile.
- **Each row and each column has exactly one unit square that is not covered by any tile.**

---

### Key Observations

This setup implies that the **uncovered squares form a permutation matrix**, i.e., there is exactly one uncovered square per row and per column. The remaining $2025^2 - 2025 = 2025 \cdot 2024$ unit squares must be covered using disjoint axis-aligned rectangles.

The problem now becomes: **What is the minimum number of axis-aligned rectangles needed to tile the complement of a permutation matrix in an $n \times n$ grid?**

Let’s denote this minimal number as $R(n)$ for general $n$. Our goal is to compute $R(2025)$.

### Symmetry Argument

A crucial insight is that **any permutation matrix can be transformed into the identity permutation matrix via row and column permutations**. Since tiling with axis-aligned rectangles is invariant under such transformations (a rectangle remains a rectangle), the **minimal number of rectangles required to tile the complement of any permutation matrix is the same** as for the identity permutation.

Thus, it suffices to analyze the case where the holes are on the main diagonal (i.e., the identity permutation).

### Tiling the Identity Permutation Complement

For the identity permutation (holes at $(i,i)$), the uncovered region consists of all squares $(i,j)$ with $i \ne j$. This is the **complement of the main diagonal**.

We can divide the grid into two regions:

- **Upper triangle**: All squares $(i,j)$ with $i < j$
- **Lower triangle**: All squares $(i,j)$ with $i > j$

Each of these triangles can be tiled with $n-1$ rectangles (as shown through induction or constructive tiling). For example, for the upper triangle $i < j$, we can use rectangles like:
- Row 1: columns 2 to $n$
- Row 2: columns 3 to $n$
- ...
- Row $n-1$: column $n$

This gives $n-1$ rectangles for the upper triangle, and similarly $n-1$ for the lower triangle.

Hence, the total number of rectangles required is:

$$
R(n) = (n - 1) + (n - 1) = 2n - 2
$$

---

### Lower Bound Justification

We can also show that **no fewer than $2n - 2$ rectangles** are possible. Consider the following two sets of points in the grid:

- **Superdiagonal**: Points $(i, i+1)$ for $i = 1$ to $n-1$
- **Subdiagonal**: Points $(i+1, i)$ for $i = 1$ to $n-1$

Each of these points lies in a different "row-column gap" due to the presence of the diagonal holes. Any rectangle containing more than one of these points would necessarily include a hole (since it would span across the diagonal), making it invalid. Therefore, **each of these $2(n - 1)$ points must lie in its own distinct rectangle**, giving a **lower bound** of $2n - 2$.

Since we have a tiling achieving this bound, it is **tight**.

---

### Final Computation

Given $n = 2025$, the minimal number of rectangles required is:

$$
2 \cdot 2025 - 2 = 4050 - 2 = \boxed{4048}
$$

### ✅ Final Answer

$$
\boxed{4048}
$$
