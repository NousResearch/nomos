## Problem

Consider a \(2025 \times 2025\) grid of unit squares. Matilda wishes to place on the grid some rectangular tiles, possibly of different sizes, such that each side of every tile lies on a grid line and every unit square is covered by at most one tile.

Determine the minimum number of tiles Matilda needs to place so that each row and each column of the grid has exactly one unit square that is not covered by any tile.

## Submission

The minimum number of tiles needed is $\boxed{4048}$.

**Proof.**  
Let $n = 2025$. Consider any placement of rectangular tiles satisfying the conditions. Let $U$ be the set of the $n$ uncovered unit squares; each row and each column contains exactly one square from $U$.

**Lower bound.**  
Compute the total perimeter $P$ of the covered region $C = \text{grid} \setminus U$. The original $n \times n$ board has perimeter $4n$. Removing a square $u \in U$ removes its $k_u$ sides that lie on the outer boundary ($k_u \in \{0,1,2\}$, because no two squares of $U$ share a side) and adds its other $4 - k_u$ sides as new boundary. Hence  

\[
P = 4n + \sum_{u \in U} (4 - 2k_u) = 8n - 2\sum_{u \in U} k_u.
\]

Exactly one square lies in row $1$, so it contributes one side on the top edge; exactly one lies in row $n$, contributing one side on the bottom edge; exactly one lies in column $1$, contributing one side on the left edge; exactly one lies in column $n$, contributing one side on the right edge. Thus $\sum k_u = 4$. Therefore $P = 8n - 8$.

Each tile is a rectangle of positive area, so its perimeter is at least $4$. If $t$ is the number of tiles, the sum of the perimeters of all tiles equals $P$ plus twice the total length of the edges that are shared by two tiles (internal edges). Since internal edges have non‑negative length,  

\[
4t \ge P \quad\Longrightarrow\quad t \ge \frac{P}{4} = 2n - 2.
\]

Thus at least $2n-2$ tiles are necessary.

**Construction.**  
Place the $n$ uncovered squares on the main diagonal: $(i,i)$ for $i = 1,\dots,n$. For every $i = 1,\dots,n-1$ put a tile covering row $i$, columns $i+1$ to $n$. For every $j = 1,\dots,n-1$ put a tile covering column $j$, rows $j+1$ to $n$. These $2n-2$ tiles are pairwise disjoint and cover every square off the diagonal. Row $i$ contains exactly the square $(i,i)$ uncovered, and column $j$ contains exactly $(j,j)$ uncovered. All tile sides lie on grid lines. Hence the condition is satisfied.

For $n = 2025$ we obtain $2\cdot 2025 - 2 = 4048$ tiles, which is optimal. ∎
