## Problem

Alice and Bazza are playing the **inekoalaty game**, a two-player game whose rules depend on a positive real number \(\lambda\) known to both players. On the \(n\)-th turn of the game (starting with \(n=1\)), the following happens:

- If \(n\) is odd, Alice chooses a nonnegative real number \(x_n\) such that
\[
x_1 + x_2 + \cdots + x_n \le \lambda n.
\]

- If \(n\) is even, Bazza chooses a nonnegative real number \(x_n\) such that
\[
x_1^2 + x_2^2 + \cdots + x_n^2 \le n.
\]

If a player cannot choose a suitable \(x_n\), the game ends and the other player wins. If the game goes on forever, neither player wins. All chosen numbers are known to both players.

Determine all values of \(\lambda\) for which Alice has a winning strategy and all those for which Bazza has a winning strategy.

## Submission

Let $S_n=\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$ and $Q_n=\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2$.  
The game ends when at the start of an odd turn $n$ we have $S_{n-1>\lambda n$ (Alice cannot move) or at the start of an even turn $n$ we have $Q_{n-1>n$ (Bazza cannot move). If the game continues forever, nobody wins.

**Lemma 1.**  
If Alice always plays $0$ on every odd turn ($x_{2k-1}=0$), then for every $k\ge 0$  
\[
S_{2k}\le k\sqrt2,\qquad Q_{2k}\le 2k.
\]

*Proof.*  
For $k=0$ it is trivial. Assume it holds for $k-1$. The numbers $b_1,\dots,b_k$ chosen by Bazza on the even turns satisfy $b_i^2\le 2i-\sum_{j<i}b_j^2$ because $Q_{2i-1=\sum_{j=1}^{i-1}b_j^2$ and he must obey $b_i^2\le 2i-Q_{2i-1$. We prove by induction that $\sum_{i=1}^k b_i\le k\sqrt2$.  
For $k=1$, $b_1^2\le2$ gives $b_1\le\sqrt2$.  
Suppose it holds for $k-1$ and set $T=\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}b_i$, $U=\sum_{i=1}^{k-1}b_i^2$. Then $b_k\le\sqrt{2k-U}$. By Cauchy–Schwarz, $T^2\le (k-1)U$, hence  
\[
\sum_{i=1}^{k}b_i\le \sqrt{(k-1)U}+\sqrt{2k-U}.
\]  
The function $f(U)=\sqrt{(k-1)U}+\sqrt{2k-U}$ is maximised on $U\in[0,2(k-1]$ at $U=2(k-1)$, giving $f_{\max}=(k-1)\sqrt2+\sqrt2=k\sqrt2$. Thus $\sum b_i\le k\sqrt2$, i.e. $S_{2k}\le k\sqrt2$. The bound $Q_{2k}\le2k$ follows directly from the game rules. ∎

**Lemma 2.**  
If Bazza always plays the maximal allowed number on even turns ($x_{2k}=\sqrt{2k-Q_{2k-1}$ when $Q_{2k-1<2k$, and $0$ otherwise), then as long as the game continues we have  
\[
Q_{2k}=2k,\qquad S_{2k}\ge k\sqrt2.
\]  
Moreover, on each odd turn the number $a_{2k+1$ chosen by Alice satisfies $a_{2k+1\le\sqrt2$.

*Proof.*  
Induction on $k$. For $k=0$: $S_0=0$, $Q_0=0$.  
Assume the statements for $k-1$. At turn $2k-1$ Alice picks $a\ge0$ with $S_{2k-2}+a\le\lambda(2k-1)$. If $a>\sqrt2$ then $a^2>2$ and $Q_{2k-1}=2k-2+a^2>2k$, so she would already win; hence we may assume $a\le\sqrt2$. Then Bazza sets $b=\sqrt{2k-(2k-2+a^2}=\sqrt{2-a^2}$. Consequently  
\[
S_{2k}=S_{2k-2}+a+\sqrt{2-a^2}\ge S_{2k-2}+\sqrt2\ge (k-1)\sqrt2+\sqrt2=k\sqrt2,
\]  
and $Q_{2k}=2k-2+a^2+(2-a^2)=2k$. Also $a\le\lambda(2k-1)-S_{2k-2\le\lambda(2k-1)-(k-1)\sqrt2$; for $\lambda\le\sqrt2$ this is $\le\sqrt2$ (and for $\lambda<\sqrt2$ it is even smaller), so $a\le\sqrt2$. ∎

### Case $\lambda > \frac1{\sqrt2}$

Alice plays $0$ on every odd turn. By Lemma 1, after each even turn $2k$ we have $S_{2k}\le k\sqrt2$. Because $\lambda>1/\sqrt2$, we have $k\sqrt2<\lambda(2k+1)$ for all $k$ (since $\frac{k\sqrt2}{2k+1}\le\frac{\sqrt2}{2}<\lambda$). Hence she can always move on odd turns.

Choose an integer $N$ such that  
\[
\lambda(2N+1)-N\sqrt2 > \sqrt{2N+2}.
\]  
Such $N$ exists because the left‑hand side grows linearly with coefficient $2\lambda-\sqrt2>0$ while the right‑hand side grows like $\sqrt{2N}$.  
At turn $2N+1$ she plays $x=\lambda(2N+1)-S_{2N}$. This is non‑negative and satisfies $S_{2N}+x=\lambda(2N+1)$, so the move is legal. Moreover  
\[
x\ge \lambda(2N+1)-N\sqrt2 > \sqrt{2N+2}\quad\Longrightarrow\quad x^2>2N+2.
\]  
Hence $Q_{2N+1}=Q_{2N}+x^2>2N+2$, so at turn $2N+2$ Bazza cannot choose any $x_{2N+2$. Therefore Alice wins. She has a winning strategy.

### Case $\lambda < \frac1{\sqrt2}$

Bazza uses the strategy of Lemma 2. Then after each even turn $2k$ we have $Q_{2k}=2k$ and $S_{2k}\ge k\sqrt2$. Also $a_{2k+1\le\sqrt2$ (so she cannot win).  
Since $2\lambda-\sqrt2<0$, there exists $k$ with $k\sqrt2>\lambda(2k+1)$. For this $k$, $S_{2k}>\lambda(2k+1)$, so at turn $2k+1$ Alice cannot move. Hence Bazza wins.

### Case $\lambda = \frac1{\sqrt2}$

If Alice always plays $0$, Lemma 1 gives $S_{2k}\le k\sqrt2=\frac{2k}{\sqrt2}<\frac{2k+1}{\sqrt2}=\lambda(2k+1)$, so she never loses; thus Bazza cannot force a win.  
If Bazza always plays max, Lemma 2 gives $a_{2k+1\le\lambda(2k+1)-S_{2k}\le\frac{2k+1}{\sqrt2}-k\sqrt2=\frac1{\sqrt2}<\sqrt2$, so $a_{2k+1^2\le\frac12<2$; Alice cannot win. Hence neither player has a winning strategy.

---

**Conclusion.**  
- Alice has a winning strategy **iff** $\displaystyle\lambda > \frac1{\sqrt2}$.  
- Bazza has a winning strategy **iff** $\displaystyle\lambda < \frac1{\sqrt2}$.  
- For $\displaystyle\lambda = \frac1{\sqrt2}$ the game may continue indefinitely; neither can force a win.
